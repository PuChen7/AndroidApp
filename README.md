# AndroidApp
This repository contains andriod apps developed by myself for learning purposes.
All the apps are developed in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

# Project List:
## 1. Calculator
### * Introduction:
This app implements a simple calculator for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
### * What I learned from this project:
* **Layouts**
  * I used `LinearLayout`(vertical) as the main structure. Each line of buttons are sub layouts(horizontal).
  * I learned how to use `layout_weight` to arrange different structures equally.
* **Button**
  * I used different button `onClick` functions to perfom button tasks such as calculation.
* **res file**
  * You don't have to put all strings into `strings.xml`, but it's a good practice for maintenance.

## 2. Movie List
### * Introduction:
This app displays a list of movies.
